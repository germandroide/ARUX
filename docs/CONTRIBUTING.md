    *   Steps to reproduce the bug.
    *   What you expected to happen.
    *   What actually happened.
    *   Your system configuration (AROS version, hardware, etc. if relevant).
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. We appreciate detailed proposals.
*   **Writing Code:** If you'd like to contribute code, please:
    1.  Fork the repository.
    2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix`).
    3.  Make your changes. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding style (details to be added).
    4.  Write unit tests for your changes if applicable.
    5.  Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
    6.  Push your branch to your fork (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
    7.  Open a pull request against the main ARUX repository.
*   **Improving Documentation:** Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial. If you see areas where the documentation can be improved, please feel free to make changes and submit a pull request. This includes the README, this CONTRIBUTING guide, and any other documentation files.
*   **Translating:** (Details to be added if internationalization becomes a goal)

### Using AI Development Tools

We encourage leveraging AI-powered tools to assist in development. To ensure these tools are used effectively and align with ARUX's architectural and quality standards, please consult our specific guidelines:

*   **[Directives for IDE Code Assistants](ai_development_guidelines/IDE_ASSISTANT_DIRECTIVES.md):** Tailored for AI assistants integrated into IDEs (e.g., GitHub Copilot).
*   **[System Prompt for ARUX Expert AI Development Assistant](ai_development_guidelines/AI_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md):** Designed for configuring conversational AI agents (e.g., Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) as expert ARUX development partners.

Familiarizing yourself with these documents can help enhance your productivity and ensure your AI-assisted contributions are well-integrated.

## Development Setup

(Details on how to set up a development environment for ARUX will be added here. This might include information on compiling Zune, setting up Amiberry, and any specific tools required for ARUX development.)

## Coding Style Guidelines

(Specific coding style guidelines for C, Python, or other relevant languages will be outlined here. This might include conventions for naming, formatting, commenting, etc.)

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
